# RPC_Proj
This project implements a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) system on a single computer using Python 3 and XML-RPC libraries. The server executes commands sent by the client via localhost, returning the results or errors. Itâ€™s ideal for learning RPC concepts and testing local inter-process communication.
